# Project Info
- In my project, I built 3 models, which were logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest
- I uttilized the sci-kit learn classifier for the titanic data classification
- We have used the module Pandas for data analysis
- The goal for this project was to determine if the ML model i built
  can accuratlty predict whether the passnegers would surive or not
  
# Data preparation
* I used relevant data in the csv file, which were the columns pclass, sex, age, fare, sibsp, parch
I dropped andy rows that had missing data
The categorical column ‘Sex’ was converted into numerical values: male as 0 and female as 1.

# Accuracy and analysis
All 3 models were fairly accurate, with its accuracy score being around 74%-78%
